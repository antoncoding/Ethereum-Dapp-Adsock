This is a basic smart contract project running with truffle webpack. We use Ropsten test net for development and testing.


## Welcome to Adsocks, an advertisement exchange platform based on blockchain technology.

#### This is a platform for  `ad exchange`. Bloggers can easily sign up our platform (with metamask), and by embedding an easy code within the html, the ad board will become available for all the other users to bid on our platform. The user who offered the highest bid within the bidding period can control the ad content in the next bidding period.

#### With Adsocks, high-quality bloggers or web content providers no longer have to use Google Adsense and get paid for almost nothing. With this platform, high-quality blogs can directly be bid from all the ad providers and get what's worth it. No fee, no third party, everything transparent and clear on the blockchain. 

p.s. The platform is still under development, please be patient about all the coming updates.
